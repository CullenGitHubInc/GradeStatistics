Start
	    Initialize a ‘Scanner’ object to read user input.
	    Declare an array ‘grades’ of size 10 to store grades.
      Declare variables ‘sum’, ‘max’, and’ min’ to track sum, maximum, and minimum grades.
      Print message asking user to enter 10 grades.
      For each grade from 1 to 10:
	          Prompt user to enter grade.
	          While input is not a valid floating-point number:
		              Print error message and prompt user to enter grade again.
	          Add valid grade to ‘grades’ array.
	          Add grade to ‘sum’. 
	          Update ‘max’ if grade is greater than current ‘max’.
	          Update ‘min’ if grade is less than current ‘min’.
      Calculate average by dividing ‘sum’ by 10.
      Print average, maximum, and minimum grades.
      Close the ‘Scanner’ object.
